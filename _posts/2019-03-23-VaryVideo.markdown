The article "Modeling Variability in the Video Domain: Language and Experience Report" has been (finally) published in a journal issue of the Software Quality Journal (Springer journal). 
It's a joint work with colleagues at University of Sevilla (Jose Galindo and David Benavides).  
This paper has a long story: in 2014 (yes, 5 years ago) we published a [technical report](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01023159) about our language. 
Since then, we have continuously improved the article, maybe more emphasizing the process and the underlying difficulties of modeling variability.
Anyway, it's available [online](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-017-9400-8) and the [preprint is available](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01688247). 

We are pursuing the work with the video generator, either for improving its [quality](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01659137) or for [exploiting video variants](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01323446).

Abstract below:
> In an industrial project, we addressed the challenge of developing a software-based video generator such that consumers and providers of video processing algorithms can benchmark them on a wide range of video variants. 
> This article aims to report on our positive experience in modeling, controlling, and implementing software variability in the video domain. 
> We describe how we have designed and developed a variability modeling language, called VM, resulting from the close collaboration with industrial partners during 2 years. 
> We expose the specific requirements and advanced variability constructs; we developed and used to characterize and derive variations of video sequences. 
> The results of our experiments and industrial experience show that our solution is effective to model complex variability information and supports the synthesis of hundreds of realistic video variants. 
> From the software language perspective, we learned that basic variability mechanisms are useful but not enough; attributes and multi-features are of prior importance; meta-information and specific constructs are relevant for scalable and purposeful reasoning over variability models. 
> From the video domain and software perspective, we report on the practical benefits of a variability approach. With more automation and control, practitioners can now envision benchmarking video algorithms over large, diverse, controlled, yet realistic datasets (videos that mimic real recorded videos)â€”something impossible at the beginning of the project.
