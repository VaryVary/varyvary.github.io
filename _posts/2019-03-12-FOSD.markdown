At the yearly [FOSD meeting](https://digital-bauhaus.github.io/website-FOSD-2019/) (a true workshop about variability, software product lines and configurable systems), Hugo Martin will pgive a talk entitled "Machine Learning for Performance Specialization of Configurable Systems". 
It's a substantial improvement/extension of ideas/experiments presented in this [technical report](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01467299). 

Juliana Alves Pereira will talk about "Machine Learning for Exploring Software Configuration Spaces: A Systematic Literature Review". 
It's an ongoing effort in which we have spent time to understand and classify the numerous recent works in the field.
