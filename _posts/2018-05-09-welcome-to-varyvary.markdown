[VaryVary](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/Projet-ANR-17-CE25-0010) (for Varying Variability) is a 4-year research project funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).
We aim to use artificial intelligence (including machine learning) for playing with software variability present in almost all real-world systems.

We are studying real-world, popular, open-source, configurable software projects like Linux, Firefox, ffmpeg, VLC, Apache or JHipster -- and we hope to have concrete impacts on them!
We are also considering different application domains like generators for media content (like videos, models for 3D printing, or technical papers written in LaTeX).
Maybe an intuitive way of understanding what we are doing is to have a look at [VaryLaTeX](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01659161). 

The scientific leader of the project is [Mathieu Acher](https://www.mathieuacher.com).
Several members of the [DiverSE team](https://diverse.irisa.fr) (IRISA/Inria research team in Rennes, France) are involved in the project.

This web site will gather some content and keep you up to date with the progress of VaryVary.
If you want more information, you can read a more complete description [here](/about), access to [publications](/publications) (all in open access), or contact us!
