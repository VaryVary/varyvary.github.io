Paul Temple and Jean-Marc Jézéquel were at [DeepTest](https://deeptestconf.github.io/), perhaps the most attended workshop at ICSE. 
They have presented "Applying Multimorphic Testing to Deep Learning Systems". 
It's an ongoing work and the workshop was informal. 

Multimorphic testing (MMT) aims to assess the effectiveness of a test suite for revealing performance variations of a system. We've promising empirical results in different contexts/domains see [ICSE'18 poster](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01730163v1) and PhD thesis of [Paul](http://www.theses.fr/2018REN1S087). 
The question is now: does MMT work for deep neural network-based systems?
