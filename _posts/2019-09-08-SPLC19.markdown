The VaryVary team has been very busy at [SPLC](https://splc2019.net/), the major venue on software product lines and variability, with:
 * a tutorial about "Machine learning and configurable systems: A gentle introduction" material is available online with [slides, data, exercices](https://github.com/VaryVary/ML-configurable-SPLCTutorial). The tutorial was well attended (around 20 people) and there were interesting interactions.
 * 3 workshops: [SPLTea](http://spltea.irisa.fr/), [REVE](http://reveworkshop.github.io), and [MODEVAR](https://modevar.github.io/program/) on different topics (teaching, reverse engineering, and modeling) and again a good audience for both 
 * a paper "Towards quality assurance of software product lines with adversarial configurations" in the main research track 
 * Juliana was chair of the student volunteers and Hugo was also student volunteer 
 * duties with SPLC steering committee
